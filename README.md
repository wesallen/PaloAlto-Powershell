# PaloAlto-Powershell

This script will take a formated list of urls and add them to a custom category on a Pala Alto Firewall.  

I pulled pices of code from several source, including Carloz Perez'z work on the powershell for Nessus Script, various posts on the Palo Alto Support site, and finally kevinsteves pan-python project was very helpful for developing the correct syntax.
